# Microsoft Teams Attendance Parser
This is a Python script that automates the work of sorting out participants present for Microsoft Teams Meeting.

## Features:
1. Removes duplicate entries and sorts alphabetically.
2. Tells whether the attendee is still in lecture during the taking of the attendance list and the last entry time.
3. Gives total time spent in the meeting in case of multiple entries (does not count last entry since MS Teams doesn't include the timestamp of the attendance downloading)

## How to use:
1. Drop your `.csv` file downloaded during the meeting into the same directory as the script.
2. Run the `MSTeamsAttendance.py` program and follow the step-by-step procedure on it.
